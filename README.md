# Python-assignment-1
1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
(a)	*   :- expressions
(b)	'hello'  :- values
(c)	-87.8  :- values
(d)	-  : - expressions
(e)	/  : - expressions
(f)	+  :- expressions
(g)	6  :- values

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
(a)	String- String are sequences/group of character data.
(b)	Variable- variable is a named location to store data.
E.g.- x="yogi"  in this expression (x) is a variable and ("yogi") is a string   

3. Describe three different data types.
(a)	String
(b)	Integer
(c)	Floats
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans:- Expression is a combination of symbols or combination operators and operands . Expression generally represents values
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Ans:- Every expression is a statement but every statement is not an expression. Expression only represents values and every executed line in the code called statement perhaps it will not produce any value.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
output:- print(bacon)
                23
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam' 
Output:- print("spam"+"spamspam")
	spamspamspam
'spam' * 3 
Output:- print("spam"*3)
	spamspamspam
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans:- Because a variable could not start from a number.
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Ans:- For Integer int() function is used to converts the value into an integer number.
      For Floating-point number float() function is used to converts the value into an floating-point number.
      For String  str() function is used to converts the value into an string.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans:- Because python can only concatenate str (not "int") to str. 
          We can fix this with F string.
          print(f"I have eaten {99} burritos.")
             I have eaten 99 burritos.
